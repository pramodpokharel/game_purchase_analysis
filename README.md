Analyzing purchase data of an online game 

Python was used to analyze purchase data for an online free-to-play game where players may buy in-game items to improve their experience. Produced extensive reports that examined purchase data, giving the organization with useful insights and practical recommendations. By detecting patterns and trends in player spending behavior, I was able to help optimize the game's monetization approach.
